The Complete PyQt5 Tutorial
---------------------------

Welcome to the Complete PyQt5 Tutorial for BE/BI!

We will cover the current infrastructure for PyQt development at CERN, with special focus on the tools
provided by BE/CO.

Is this tutorial for me?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This tutorial targets Python developers who need an in-depth introduction to CERN's ecosystem.
Therefore it assumes you are quite familiar with Python, but does not require you to know any PyQt
before starting.

If you have no idea what an ``__init__.py`` file does, please follow a good Python tutorial first (LINKS HERE).

If you are comfortable with Python, but you have no idea what a ``myform.ui`` file might be, then this is the
place for you. Otherwise, you might consider trying with the PyQt5 Fast Tutorial first, and eventually head back here
if you feel like you'd like to brush up your PyQt5 knowledge too.
