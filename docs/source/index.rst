PyQt5 Mega Tutorial
-------------------

Welcome to the PyQt5 Mega Tutorial for BE/BI!

We will cover the current infrastructure for PyQt development at CERN, with special focus on the tools
provided by BE/CO.

Where do I start?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
We provide a two-tier tutorial:

 - The **Fast Tutorial**, for people that already has some PyQt5 knowledge and wants to know more about the available
   tools. It does not cover most of the details of PyQt5 itself: if you get lost, consider switching to the option
   below.

 - The **Complete Tutorial**, for people coming from Java or C++, or even Python programmers that simply have no
   prior knowledge of PyQt5. Note that the tutorial assumes some basic Python knowledge, and in general will not
   dive too much into pure Python details. If you have doubts along the way, Google is your friend.

Both tutorials are equipped with videos, runnable code and descriptions. They mostly cover the same content, i.e. the
videos cover the same materials as their host page, and they both refer to the same code.
