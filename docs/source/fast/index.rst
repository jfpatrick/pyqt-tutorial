The Fast PyQt5 Tutorial
-----------------------

Welcome to the PyQt5 Fast Tutorial for BE/BI!

We will cover the current infrastructure for PyQt development at CERN, with special focus on the tools
provided by BE/CO.

.. note:: Remember that `the Acc-Py documentation <https://wikis.cern.ch/display/ACCPY/Accelerating+Python+Home>`_ is
    always the only official resource regarding Acc-Py features.
    If you have any trouble, please refer to their documentation first to make sure this page is not outdated.

Is this tutorial for me?
------------------------

This tutorial targets Python developers who need a quick introduction to CERN's ecosystem.
Therefore it assumes you are quite familiar with Python and have some basic knowledge of PyQt5 too.

If you have no idea what an ``__init__.py`` file does, please follow a good Python tutorial first (LINKS HERE).

If you are comfortable with Python, but you have no idea what a ``myform.ui`` file might be, then head to the
:ref:`complete_tutorial` . It's similar in structure to this tutorial, but is sensibly longer and covers
also the basics of PyQt5. Alternatively, please follow any good PyQt5 tutorial you can find, and then come back.
