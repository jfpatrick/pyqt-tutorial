In this section we cover the most relevant development tools for PyQt Expert GUIs: **PyCharm** and **Qt Designer**.

PyCharm
=======

PyCharm is the recommended IDE for developing Python applications. If you're new to it, you can find some tutorials
`below <3-tools.html#pycharm_tutorials>`_.

The Acc-Py team offers also a shared PyCharm instance on TN machines. If you are using the template provided by
``bipy-gui-manager``, it is already on your ``PATH`` and it can be launched with::

    pycharm.sh . &

from your project's root directory (the folder that contains your ``setup.py``).

Otherwise, you can find the instance under::

	/acc/local/share/python/pycharm/pycharm-community-2019.2.3/

and can be launched by executing::

    /acc/local/share/python/pycharm/pycharm-community-2019.2.3/bin/pycharm.sh . &

always from your project's root directory.

Remember that adding a path after the command makes PyCharm load that folder as a starting project. So if you're
launching PyCharm from a different folder, replace the dot with the path to the project's root folder.

.. note::
    In some cases PyCharm might not manage to find your virtual environment and will throw a lot of exceptions
    regarding broken imports and features unsupported in Python 2.7.
    If this happens to you, apply this extra setup step explained on the
    `Acc-Py Wikis <https://wikis.cern.ch/display/ACCPY/PyQt+distribution#PyQtdistribution-LaunchingPyCharmfromthesystemmenu>`_

.. warning::
    Technically PyCharm does not strictly need a path to start. For example, desktop application launchers do not
    provide a path to it.

    However, at the time of writing (May 2020) PyCharm presents one serious bug with the Open Project folder explorer,
    which makes it hang for several minutes every time it tries to access an AFS directory (like most user's homes).
    Therefore it's important to launch PyCharm from the relevant directory, as explained above, until the issue is
    fixed.

.. note:: Although recommended, PyCharm is not mandatory. If you're comfortable with other editors (VSCode,
    Eclipse, Emacs, ...) feel free to use them instead.

Qt Designer
===========

The recommended way to implement your PyQt5 GUIs is to use ``.ui`` files to define your interface. Therefore,
Acc-Py-PyQt provides you with a shared instance of the **Qt Designer**.

Once you activated the virtuanenv, you can launch it by typing::

	designer <path-to-your-file.ui>

Some CERN libraries like ``accwidgets`` (see `next section <5-libraries.html#accwidgets>`_) provide extra widgets
that can be used from the Designer.
However, those widgets are not picked up automatically: you should make sure you have the ``PYQTDESIGNERPATH``
environment variable set to the correct folder. For example, for ``accwidgets`` the value would be::

    PYQTDESIGNERPATH=<path-to-your-project-virtualenv>/lib/python3.6/site-packages/accwidgets/graph/designer

Refer to your library's documentation to know which paths to add to this variable to enable their
Qt Designer widgets plugin. If you have trouble with a library, you can also check the
`official Qt documentation <https://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/adding-plugins.html#locating-qt-designer-plugins>`_
for hints.

.. note:: You can also build your own custom Qt Designer plugins! See the relevant page on the
    `Acc-Py wikis <https://wikis.cern.ch/display/ACCPY/Widgets#Widgets-ImplementingcustomQtWidgets>`_
    for an overview of the process.
